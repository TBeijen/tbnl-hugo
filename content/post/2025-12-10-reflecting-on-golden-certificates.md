Recently I passed the last of the exams that grants the [Golden Kubestronaut](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/resources/kubestronaut-program/) title. And it was quite the journey.

About twenty years ago, I dabbled a bit in certification via PHP and Zend. Back then, PHP tried to be corporate Java, including the design patterns and certifications that come with it. And I went along. Let's say it has been a phase, in which I built quite some monstrosities. But that's for another time.

Then came a long period in which I learned a lot, just didn't feel the need to focus on certification. And now I've suddenly got fifteen of them. Sixteen even, if counting the odd AWS SAA exam. How did that come?
