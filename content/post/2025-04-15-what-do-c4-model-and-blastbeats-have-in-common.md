Past Friday I had a focus day, hardly any meetings and time to do some scheduled deep work. Also, Friday is 'release day' which always means anticipating on new album drops[^footnote_albums]. Past Friday saw the luxury of two excellent new albums being released: Biographyte by Cytotoxin and Aspiral by Epica. Both albums where 'a lot is happening'.

For a bit of context: I work as a consultant, architect, engineer and everything in between in tech. So part is meetings, part is more hands-on requiring focus. In my teens acts like Guns'n'Roses and Metallica have been a gateway into more extreme types of music. So, these days I listen to acts incorporating elements deemed inaccessible by many: [Blastbeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_beat), cookie monster vocals and speeds of 240bpm and higher[^footnote_280bpm]. I played some guitar so consider myself a guitar-nerd. I'm also a drum-nerd but never played drums. Simply put: I don't have the chops to play to music I listen, and don't have the time to acquire them[^footnote_practice].

Many times I have wondered (and so have others) how it is possible that I can focus on work while listening to music that is, let's be frank, quite intense. After all, there are also people that need ambient sound to be able to focus.

Pondering that during my weekend run, it struck me that I focus on music at different levels of details, very similar to how I switch between more engineering and a more architectural perspectives. Let's dive in!









* Genre: 
* Song: 
* Composition
* Detail level. 



* Goes from regular blastbeat, to gravity blast, to half-time with 16th kicks, to regular thrash beat. All while guitars are doing 3-3-3-3-4 patterns over a 4/4 beat (Hope Terminator).
* Hey, this riff is more thrash-influenced than they've done so far. (The Everslave at the ~1:30 mark)
* Interesting how they seamlessly go from a burst of aggression, blastbeats and bombast, back to the earworm chorus (The Grand Saga of Existence, from 5:10)
* Funny, how Cytotoxin is mostly hyperspeed blastbeats, using slower more groove-oriented parts as accents, whereas Epica is more accessible and slower, yet using fast parts as accents.


Levels, bottom level there can be chaos. Gets context via more coarse levels.

[^footnote_albums]: Telling my age without telling my age. Yes, I listen to full albums.

[^footnote_280bpm]: The good thing about the 260-280bpm speed range is, that if you go half-time, all your dance-floor skills still apply.

[^footnote_practice]: Assuming that would depend only on practice, and not on talent. Maybe when the kids grow older and arthritis hasn't yet got a foothold.
