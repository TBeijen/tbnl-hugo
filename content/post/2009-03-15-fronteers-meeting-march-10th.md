At the PHPgg Frontend Special I first heard of [Fronteers][1], an association of dutch front-end developers. Past tuesday they had a meeting at Media College in Amsterdam. As meetings are open for non(yet)-members it was a nice opportunity to get to know more about Fronteers. Two topics were scheduled: jQuery and SUAVE.

### jQuery

Until now I have mainly used the [Prototype][2] framework for Javascript projects. As the prototype library, escpecially when bundled with scriptaculous, is quite &#8216;big&#8217; I was interested in hearing some more about the &#8216;lean and mean&#8217; jQuery. In a short (but focussed) presentation of Edwin Martin some of the key aspects of jQuery were illustrated, most notably: [Method chaining][3], [Plugins][4] (nice for keeping things organised) and [Live events][5] (curious about performance). The jQuery motto &#8216;do more, write less&#8217; definitely stands although the functionality seems really focused on selecting, modifying and event-binding. I was missing Prototype&#8217;s class inheritance but as I read from the [Fronteers meeting report][6] that&#8217;s being worked in in the form of [Classy Query][7].

### Suave

Next was a presentation, delivered by Marcel Beumer and Vincent Hillenbrink, about Suave, a stand-alone front-end. It&#8217;s a MVC based framework that allows front-end developers to communicate with a &#8216;back-end&#8217; that exists solely in the viewer&#8217;s browser. This way front-end developers can start creating templates and interaction and show working versions, without being dependent on properly functioning back-end software. In the background there is some XSLT databound templating going on thereby allowing for easy integration with back-end software once it&#8217;s ready. Suave isn&#8217;t finished yet so no online information is available. They aim at releasing a first version in about half a year, bundled with examples demonstrating it&#8217;s potential.

Of course there was plenty of time after the presentations to meet some people and chat with co-front-end-developers. Nice meeting!
