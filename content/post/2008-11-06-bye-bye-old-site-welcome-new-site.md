As it looks like the blogging phenomenon is there to stay I finally considered it safe to take my first steps into the blogosphere. Until recently this domain showed the website I developed in 2003 and haven&#8217;t updated since. It&#8217;s a technology-push javascript showcase. Something I liked back then (the days when dHTML was fancy) but would never build again now. For starters: It&#8217;s not accessible and thereby not search engine friendly. The popups, if they get past popup-blockers, don&#8217;t help usability either. There are two things I still like though: 

  * It still works. The css, the javascript that keeps everything in place, the event-handling. It proves that standard-compliance can get you far.
  * It uses a technique similar to what now is called Ajax. Content is loaded by javascript using hidden iFrames and then moved to the visible areas. I liked the days when there was less talking about Ajax&#8230;

[Judge for yourself.][1]

Maybe before the end of the decade I&#8217;ll look into that &#8216;twitter&#8217; I keep reading about&#8230;
