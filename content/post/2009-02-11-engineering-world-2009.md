Past saturday (february 7th) I visited [Engineering World][1], a conference organised by Sogeti, as both attendant and speaker. With my colleague [Richard de Vries][2] I delivered a presentation on the topic usability. I attended some interesing presentations of which two were about methodologies: One about SCRUM and the closing keynote by Ian Spence of Ivar Jacobsen International about Agile. The latter with all of the myths about Agile (Doesn&#8217;t matter where the team is going, as long as it&#8217;s going somewhere) being tackled in true Mythbuster fashion. Another (and totally different) presentation was about &#8216;augmented reality&#8217; and was delivered by [Touching Media][3]. Picture yourself (in your younger years) in a Lego store, holding a box in front of a camera, and seeing yourself on screen with a 3D representation of the Lego model coming out of the box. Nice.
