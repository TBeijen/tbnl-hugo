Although my blog was ready for quite some time I had some trouble getting my domain to point at it. The main problem was getting control over the DNS settings as tibobeijen.nl was originally registered with a shared hosting company. At that time a viable solution as registering a .nl domain used to be limited to companies. Although the whole procedure was a bit sluggish it&#8217;s finally complete. Kuddo&#8217;s to my friends at [Yuna][1] for providing quality hosting. Lessons learnt:

  1. Spending some extra dimes and staying in control of your domain is worth all of it.
  2. Even though your site might be &#8216;hidden&#8217; and nowhere published, spambots _will_ find it&#8230;
