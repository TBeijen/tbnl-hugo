Today I stumbled across an interesting new Firefox extension: [FireScope][1]. It&#8217;s developed by Sitepoint, a site I visit regularly. I was aware of their [reference material on html, css and javascript][2] and now they use that content to feed this extension. FireScope is an extension to Firebug, assumably known and installed by anyone interested in FireScope. On the [official firefox add-ons page][3] it has the status &#8216;experimental&#8217; and hence requires logging in. On the [FireScope page][1] it can be installed after selecting &#8216;allow&#8217; on the Firefox warning. It looks like Firefox for developers got even better&#8230;
