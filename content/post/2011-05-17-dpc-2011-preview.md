The yearly dutch PHP event is getting close so time to check out the schedule. Once again there are lots of interesting sessions to choose from so I probably will miss some of the good stuff. Mixing &#8216;simply interesting&#8217; and &#8216;directly usable in day-to-day job&#8217; results in the preliminary list: 

### Day 1

  * [TDD and Getting Paid][1] &#8211; Because indeed TDD is good and can be hard to keep doing thoroughly</a>
  * [Pursuing practices of Domain-Driven Design in PHP][2] &#8211; Fits both the &#8216;interesting&#8217; and &#8216;directly usable&#8217; categories. Based on the numerous articles by Giorgio I have high expectations</a>
  * [Cooking up your development environment][3] &#8211; Tools I don&#8217;t know, yet a subject that&#8217;s very real
  * [Simplify your external dependency management][4] &#8211; Or the Uncon, depending on the schedule
  * [Implementing Comet using PHP][5] &#8211; Interesting new stuff (for me that is)
  * [Zend Framework 2.0: what&#8217;s new and what&#8217;s changed?][6] &#8211; However, Advanced OO Patterns looks interesting too
  * [Conference social][7] &#8211; yup

### Day 2

  * Pofiling, OAuth, new era of PHP Frameworks &#8211; All interesting, to be decided
  * [Managing a shared MySQL farm][8] &#8211; Because I expect to hear more new things than at the Zend Framework optimization talk
  * Agility and Quality, Modular application architecture and Character sets that suck (they do!) &#8211; Tough one once again. I think [Agility and Quality][9]
  * [Practical Git]() &#8211; I think, because there&#8217;s a lot to learn there, although Zend Framework i18n looks interesting too
  * [Keynote: Open Teams][10] &#8211; Will probably be insightful as well as enjoyable

Now I only need to print the ticket, bookmark this page on my iPhone and I&#8217;m off to go. Till friday!
