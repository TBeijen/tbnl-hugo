## Introduction

Once or twice a year, NU.nl organizes a hackathon, allowing its IT staff to dabble in new technology and pursue ideas, usually guided by a number of themes. 2023 kicked off with a hackathon having the themes 'NU2030', 'NU.nl from scratch' and 'A greener NU.nl'.

Mid 2022 I [visited EdgeCase](/2022/06/01/edgecase-2022), a 1-day conference about running Kubernetes at the edge. One of the presentations was by [LeafCloud](https://www.leaf.cloud/), a hosting provider focusing on reducing the environmental impact of cloud computing by re-using the heat that it generates. 

Back then I somewhat jokingly proposed to run our `/klimaat` section from LeafCloud. So, knowing we have most of our compute on Kubernetes, one of the compute platforms offered, and one of this Hackathon's themes being climate, there is no better moment to do a POC.

In this blogpost:


**Disclaimer:** This is a _personal_ blog. So while NU.nl (part of DPG Media) facilitated the hackathon and supports the theme, opinions and conclusions are mine. This post holds no commitment in any way from NU.nl or DPG Media.

## LeafCloud

LeafCloud uses the heat generated by servers to [substitute the use of fossil fuel for heating](https://www.leaf.cloud/truly-green). It does so by constructing LeafSites at the location where heat is needed, such as swimming pools or apartment buildings. In short:

> Don't bring cooling to the datacenter. Bring the datacenter to the cooling.

It's a creative and pragmatic approach to address the environmental impact which - it might be my background of Industrial Design engineering - resonates well with me.

Now there's various other ways to reduce environmental impact of running compute:

* Right-sizing and autoscaling
* Serverless
* More efficient CPU such as ARM

There is no 'or' here, all of them are worth pursuing. However, as below image shows, none of them might be as effective as using hosting that's designed from the ground up to be environmental-friendly.

## POC outline

Below image shows a simplified outline of NU.nl architecture. Website and mobile apps consume a Backend For Frontend (BFF), which in turn uses various other APIs (mostly REST) APIs. All is frontend by Akamai to keep the bad guys away.

Data and private network APIs constitute gravity, moving away from it tends to be hard. Compute consuming public APIs is easy, it can run anywhere.
