Today I ordered my ticket for [Dutch PHP Conference][1]. Last year&#8217;s edition was great and this year it&#8217;s twice as long. This year I&#8217;ll skip the tutorial day though. For me the money is better spent on reading material. Anyone interested in going can save some money by registering before April 30th. My &#8216;usability and PHP&#8217; paper didn&#8217;t make it but on the less PHP focused topics there _is_ [accessibility][2]. And a lot of other interesting topics. Presentations I will probably be attending: [All the Little Pieces: Distributed systems with PHP][3], [Secure Programming with the Zend Framework][4] and [Habits of Highly Scalable Web Applications][5].
