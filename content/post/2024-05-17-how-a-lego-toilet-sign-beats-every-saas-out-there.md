## Introduction

To me, ever since occasionally needing to use it, 'enterprise software' is the definition of software that makes people feel unhappy. Except perhaps for the people that make money of it. It miraculously gets something done, _despite_ its horrendous user experience, in the process sapping all energy of whoever is forced to use it[^footnote_pun].

So, when I recently saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1786493141329051735) by Jason Fried, this part resonated well with me:

> ... because the world is flooded with overpriced, crappy, subpar software. It hurts people, and it hurts the economy.

Agreed.

Shortly after that, while on a long run, I listened to [this episode of Lenny's podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/crafting-a-compelling-product-vision-ebi-atawodi-youtube-netflix-uber/), featuring Ebi Atawodi. A great episode, ending with the recurring item 'lightning rounds', that includes the question "What is a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates?". For product roles, her answer was:

> Tell me your favorite product that you are passionate about and why?

Now that's an interesting one.

Continuing my outdoor run, I gave it some thought, initially focusing on applications. And, although luckily not every application is as awful as described above, nothing really stands out either. But once I expanded the scope to physical products, the question became easy and one answer immediately popped up:

## The LEGO House

The [LEGOÂ® House](https://legohouse.com/), "Home of the Brick", is a marvelous combination of architecture and industrial design, located in Billund. It is what LEGO calls an experience center. 

And the stand out thing that put a smile on my face was the sign on the toilet, urging visitors to wash their hands.

Admitted, I am a fan of Lego. But even if one is not, there is a lot to appreciate. What is it that sets the LEGO house miles apart from the average software application?

### Attention to detail in every aspect

Everything in the Lego house gives the impression that it exists for a reason and is thought through. Of course the large models steal the show, as do the play areas. But wherever you look, the design language is consistent:

* The building itself has the shape of LEGO bricks
* The primary colors of the 4 zones match the oldest primary LEGO brick colors
* As a souvenir you get a set of bricks forming a unique code, molded on the spot
* There is the MINI CHEF restaurant, where you build your orders using LEGO bricks

And yes, this attention to detail goes all the way to the signing.

Whereas in software there can be screen noise (data), in the LEGO HOUSE there is real noise (people), distracting from navigation: Where do I want to go? Where do I _need_ to go? Providing guidance through the noise is important.

Attention to details results in consistency, which builds trust, and increases efficiency and helps navigate a product. Or building. It [reduces cognitive load](https://www.ics.com/blog/most-important-reason-consistency-design-ux).

### Fun, or at least: Pleasant

When I visited Japan, one of the (many) remarkable things were the signs in subways, warning to not get your hand stuck between the doors: Cute creatures warning playfully for something very serious.

The wash your hands sign in the LEGO House has that same energy.

Now, this level of playfulness might not be appropriate everywhere. After spending millions on a CRM, people might find furry animals pointing out the field you forgot to fill in, a bit too much. We all remember MS Office Clippy, right?

But, there is a wide range between playfulness to the point of being over-the-top on the one hand, and [cubicle layout](https://hbr.org/2013/11/research-cubicles-are-the-absolute-worst#:~:text=The%20bottom%20line%3A%20workers%20in,out%20of%20those%2015%20factors.) levels of awfulness and dread on the other hand. Software, even if the underlying subject is not particularly exciting, does not _need_ to be unpleasant.

### Confidence

Adding playful elements to otherwise lacking design won't work. It's like painting a wooden window frame without first taking care of the wood rot. Exhibit A: The aforementioned Clippy.

But, just like well-placed easter eggs, if done right, playfull elements can convey a message of "We got this sorted, everything under control. We can have a bit of fun here". Which circles back to building trust. 

### Taking the user seriously



## Back to software applications


## How to improve

### Make UI/UX design part of the team

### Simplify processes, not just the UI

### Do real user tests

### Continuously improve

A/B tests etc.
Merchants do this 



* Business processes (constraints, regulation, compliance, privacy)



[^footnote_pun]: Yes, pun intended. And no, there hardly ever is anything voluntary about using enterprise software.
