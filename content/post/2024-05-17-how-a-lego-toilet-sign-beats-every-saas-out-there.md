## Introduction

In my book, ever since occasionally needing to use it, 'enterprise software' is the definition of software that makes everybody feel unhappy. Except perhaps for the people that make money of it. It miraculously gets something done, _despite_ its horrendous user experience, in the process sapping all energy of whoever is forced to use it[^footnote_pun].

So, when I recently saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1786493141329051735) by Jason Fried, this part resonated well with me:

> ... because the world is flooded with overpriced, crappy, subpar software. It hurts people, and it hurts the economy.

Agreed.

Shortly after that, I listened to [this episode of Lenny's podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/crafting-a-compelling-product-vision-ebi-atawodi-youtube-netflix-uber/), featuring Ebi Atawodi. A great episode, ending with the recurring item 'lightning rounds' that includes the question "What is a favourite interview question you like to ask candidates?". For product roles her answer was:

> Tell me your favourite product that you are passionate about and why?

Now that's an interesting one.

Continuing my run, I gave it some thought, initially focusing on applications. And, although luckily not every application is as awful as described above, nothing really stands out either. But once I expanded the scope to fysical products, the question became easy and one answer immediately popped up:

## The LEGO House


## Design qualities

### Care


### Playfulness


### Confidence


[^footnote_pun]: Yes, pun intended. And no, there hardly ever is anything voluntary about using enterprise software.
