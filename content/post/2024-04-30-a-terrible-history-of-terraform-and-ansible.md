## Introduction

After IBM [acquired Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future) in 2019, it recently has [acquired HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-joins-ibm). So now Big Blue not only has [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) in its portfolio, but also [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Tech articles and social media galore, and many people have found out that if you mix 'Terraform' and 'Ansible', you end up with 'Terrible'. Depending on your tech stack, it _is_ a great combination: Terraform to provision cloud infrastructure, including servers. Ansible to configure those servers.

That was exactly the combination of capabilities needed by Sanoma Media Netherlands, in 2016. An in-house tool was created and, as a play of words, it was named... Terrible.

> This is the first article of a series 'Stuff From The Past (SFTP)', for which I have got a number topics lined up. Things I have written or should not have written. Things I have worked with or would rather not have. How did those systems age? What can be learned?

Author's note 1: This topic was at some random place in my blog topic list. But since a lot of people are making terrible jokes, there is no better moment than now.

Author's note 2: I did not _build_ Terrible, but was one of its power users and worked quite closely with the team maintaining it. Shout out to the forward thinkers that understood the need for this tool and made it happen.

Author's note 3: Everything described leading up to the creation of Terrible is based on my perspective, and my recollection and knowledge of matters. All of those might be inaccurate or incomplete.
