### The professional
I'm employed as lead developer / architect of the web team of [NU.nl][2] (Part of [DPG Media][1]), the largest news site in the Netherlands. I do DevOps, AWS Cloud engineering, Kubernetes, Python, Javascript and quite some other buzzwords. 

I studied [Industrial Design Engineering][3] so I'm comfortable with talking about UI, UX, colors and pixels as well.

The way I (aspire to) work can best be described as 'agile architecting':

> Look far. Look wide. Look deep. Review. Repeat.

This field of work is constantly changing. So, while confident I've learned a lot over the years, I'm convinced there is a lot more that I still need to learn.

### The person
I run (quite a lot) and play tennis (occasionally). I love to hangout with my girlfriend and kids. I'm a cat person (not neccessarily hating dogs). Furthermore I like the caffeinating effect of heavy music, when coding or otherwise (As a tribute, the color scheme of this site is based on the cover of [one of my favorite albums][4]). Lastly, my dark age has ended and I can be considered an adult fan of Lego (AFOL).

### Disclaimer
Opinions are my own and could be subject to change (never stop learning).
