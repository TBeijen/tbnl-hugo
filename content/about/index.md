### The developer
I'm a developer, working at [Sanoma Technology][1], and more specifically [NU.nl][2], the largest news site in the Netherlands. I do API design, Python, DevOps, AWS, Javascript, Ansible and tons of other buzzwords. 

I studied [Industrial Design Engineering][3] so I'm comfortable with talking about UI and UX and care about pixels also.

In my opinion one of the hardest challenges in IT, besides obviously naming things and cache invalidation, is coming up with simple solutions for complex problems instead of the other way around.

### The guy
I play tennis. I love to hangout with my girlfriend and little daughter. I'm a cat person (not neccessarily hating dogs). Furthermore I like the caffeinating effect of loud music, when coding or otherwise (As a tribute, the color scheme of this site is based on the cover of [one of my favorite albums of the past decade][4])
